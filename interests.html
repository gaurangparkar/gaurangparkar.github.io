<h2 id="other-interests">Other Interests</h2>
<p>A large chunk of my life is spent outside of technology and physics. Some of them include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music: I am deeply passionate about music and enjoy different kinds of music genres ranging from Indian classical to punk, to experimental music. I also play several musical instruments like drums, bass, guitar, keyboard, different synths, etc, with guitar being the main instrument of choice. I sometimes play for a local punk-inspired band called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tri_stykker/">tri stk.</a>. I am always looking for new musical projects to indulge in whenever I have the time. Contact me if you have any cool ideas and need a collaboration. </li>
<li>Climbing: I enjoy climbing and bouldering both indoors and outdoors. I try to get outdoors as much as the Stavanger weather permits.</li>
<li>Surfing: I picked up surfing after moving to Stavanger as Jaeren has some of the best beaches I have ever seen. The feeling of riding waves is unlike anything else.</li>
<li>Mountain biking: I enjoy riding my bike on mountain trails especially going downhill.</li>
