<h1 id="software">Software</h1>
<h4 id="operating-system">Operating system</h4>
<p>I use MacOS as my operating system since mid 2022. I had used <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> and <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu </a> for many years before that but switched to MacOS due to the performance and power efficiency of Apple Silicon chips. 
Here are some useful tools to make MacOS more usable. Most of these would require you to have brew and macports.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle</a> : Rectangle is a window manager for MacOS with useful keyboard shortcuts. When using MacOS for the first time I was frustrated due to the lack of a native window manager.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grishka/NearDrop">Neardrop</a> : Brings the functionality of AirDrop on an android phone using Quickshare&#47;Nearby share.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl#readme">MonitorControl</a> : Controls the brightness of external displays.</li>
<li><a href="https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/">Skim</a> : A better pdf reader than preview.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="programming-languages">Programming languages</h4>
<ul>
<li>I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a> as my main editor for most applications like building this website. I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> for larger projects.</li>
<li>I use the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming language for most of my calculations. It has almost C&#47;C++ like performance while being sufficiently high level and easy to use.</li>
<li>I also use <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Wolfram Mathematica</a> for small calculations or when symbolic manipulation in needed.</li>
<li>For high performance computing I use libraries in C and C++ especially because a lot of code is already available for use. </li>
<li>I started learning programming with <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> for a computational physics class, however I have not used it much since I started using Julia as I find it to be quite slow and clunky.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="writing-reports">Writing reports</h4>
<ul>
<li>I use <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">Latex</a> for writing documents.</li>
<li>I mainly use <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer">beamer</a> to make presentations. I also like the MacOS presentation app called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software)">Keynote</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="useful-libraries">Useful Libraries</h4>
<p>These are some libraries that I have used for my work over the past few years, in no particular order of importance.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fastsum.gitlab.io/">OpenQCD-fastsum</a> :  This C package written and maintained by the fastsum collaboration extends the OpenQCD code for anisotropic lattices.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LatticeQCD/SIMULATeQCD">SIMULATeQCD</a> : This C++ package is designed to run Lattice QCD code on Multiple GPU&#8217;s. I used this package to do gauge fixing and measure Wilson Line correlators on already generated configurations.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Jutho/TensorOperations.jl">TensorOperations</a> : A julia package for fast and efficient tensor operations using the Einstein index notation. </li>
<li><a href="https://fluxml.ai/">flux</a> : This is a library for machine learning in native Julia.</li>
<li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_">scikit-learn</a> : Machine learning library for python.</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12qsJWTqzxjQ5itQoAN9HssCfP-vgNTOK/view?usp=sharing">diffgeo</a> : A Mathematica package for doing GR-type tensor algebra and calculus.</li>
<li><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5102934">BR Method</a> : A C package that implements the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6106">Bayesian Reconstruction(BR)</a> method for extracting spectral function from Lattice QCD correlators.</li>
</ul>
