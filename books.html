<ul>
<li>Modern Quantum Mechanics by Sakurai and Napolitano : Standard text book for anyone wanting to learn Quantum mechanics. It introduces the topic in a modern way as opposed to the historical way as it was developed.</li>
<li>Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model by Schwartz : Perfect beginner self contained book for someone wanting to learn quantum field theory. I have tried to read several other books on the subject, but none is as beginner friendly.</li>
<li>Scaling and Renormalization in Statistical Physics by John Cardy : A great book to understand the mysterious topic of Renormalization in quantum field theory and Statistical physics. Before I read this book renormalization felt like black magic.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="economy-and-politics">Economy and politics</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder by Nassim Taleb : Not a huge fan of his style and it can seem a bit cringe at times, but some interesting ideas put forth. Tableb has written several books, but I think this one brings together most of his ideas in one.</li>
<li>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media by Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman : Chomsky has written a lot of books outside of his academic field of Linguistics
