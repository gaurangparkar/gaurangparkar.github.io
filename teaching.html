<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
<p>I have taught and assisted on several courses.</p>
<h4 id="at-university-of-stavanger-uis">At University of Stavanger (UIS)</h4>
<ul>
<li>FYS102 (Autumn 2023) Fysikk for data&#47;elektro:
Basic introductory course on mechanics for computer scientists. Organised tutorial classes and graded mandatory assignments.</li>
<li>MAT100 Matematiske metoder 1 (Taught in Norwegian) (Autumn 2020, Autumn 2021):
Introduction to the basic topic in real analysis: limits, continuity, derivation, integration and differential equations.  Managed teaching assistants and graded mandatory assignments.</li>
<li>MAT 200 Mathematical Methods 2 (Spring 2023) :
Introduction to Linear Algebra, power series, Taylor series, Fourier series, functions of multiple variables. Mathematical software (Python). I managed the teaching assistants, created solutions for assignments and graded them.</li>
<li>FYS200 Thermo- and Fluid Dynamics (Autumn 2022): 
Introduction to Pressure, temperature and ideal gases. Phases of matter, phase transitions and phase diagrams. Energy conservation and the first law of thermodynamics. Work, heat, internal energy and enthalpy in open and closed systems. Irreversible processes, entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. Cyclic processes, heat engines, refrigerators and heat pumps. Fluid properties. Fluid statics, buoyancy. Lift and drag. I organised tutorial classes for the course.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="at-stony-brook-university">At Stony Brook University</h4>
<ul>
<li>PHY 133 Laboratory for Classical Physics (I) (Spring 2018):
Introductory labs to give an understanding of basic experimental methods applied in physical sciences. Experiments included simple pendulum, projectile motion, atwood machine, conservation of momentum and energy, simple harmonic motion, standing waves and ideal gas law. I organised two lab sessions on each of the experiments and graded the lab reports and exams.</li>
<li>PHY 134 Laboratory for Classical Physics (II) (Fall 2018):
Introductory labs to give an understanding of basic experimental methods applied in Electromagnetism.</li>
