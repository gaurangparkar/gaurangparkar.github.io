<h2 id="some-resources-for-physics">Some resources for Physics</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of physics textbooks and other resources that I have used over the years.</p>
<h4 id="physics-textbooks">Physics textbooks</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Modern Quantum Mechanics by Sakurai and Napolitano</em> : Standard text book for anyone wanting to learn Quantum mechanics. It introduces the topic in a modern way as opposed to the historical way as it was developed.</li>
<li><em>Quantum Fields on a Lattice</em> by Istvan Montvay, Gernot MÃ¼nster: Reference book on Lattice field theory. </li>
<li><em>Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model by Schwartz</em> : Perfect beginner self contained book for someone wanting to learn quantum field theory. I have tried to read several other books on the subject, but none is as beginner friendly.</li>
<li><em>Scaling and Renormalization in Statistical Physics by John Cardy</em>: A great book to understand the mysterious topic of Renormalization in quantum field theory and Statistical physics. Before I read this book renormalization felt like black magic.</li>
<li><em>A First Course in String Theory by Barton Zwiebach</em> : Good introductory book for someone who wants to learn some basics of string theory. The nice thing is that you don&#8217;t need much of a background in field theory or mathematics to pick up and read this one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="--electrodynamics-and-quantum-mechanics-by-griffiths-good-series-of-introductory-textbooks-for-anyone-getting-into-physics.">- <em>Electrodynamics and Quantum mechanics</em> by Griffiths : Good series of introductory textbooks for anyone getting into physics.</h2>
